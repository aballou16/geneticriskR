The goal of geneticriskR is to provide standard formatting, statistical analyses
and plotting for polygenic risk score data generated using [PRSice-2](https://www.prsice.info/) software. 
Because recent genetic risk studies have shown a great deal of inconsistency, 
this package will aid the reproducibility of future studies.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of geneticriskR from 
[Github](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aballou16/geneticriskR")
```

## Example(s)

This is a basic example which demonstrates how to run a simple logistic 
regression model using an example output file from PRSice-2 called "test_data." 

```{r}

```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(geneticriskR)
View(test_data)
simple_mod <- simple_logistic_reg(test_data, hypertension)
simple_mod
```

This is another example which demonstrates how to run roc/auc analysis on the
model generated above. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(geneticriskR)
proc_analysis(test_data, "hypertension", simple_mod)
```

This is an example of one of the standard plots included in most PRS analyses:
the side by side box plot comparing scores for cases and conrols. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(geneticriskR)
compare_boxplots(test_data, hypertension, prs)
```
